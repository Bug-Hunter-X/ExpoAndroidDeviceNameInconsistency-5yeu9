This improved approach attempts to retrieve the device name using multiple strategies, offering greater resilience:
```javascript
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';

export async function getDeviceName() {
  let deviceName = Constants.deviceName;
  if (!deviceName || deviceName.trim() === '') {
    // If the default method fails, consider other approaches
    // (these may require additional permissions or libraries)
    try {
      // Example: using a third-party library to access device information
      // You may need to install and configure a specific library
      // deviceName = await getDeviceNameFromThirdPartyLib(); 
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error getting device name:', error);
      deviceName = 'Unknown';
    }
  }
  return deviceName;
}
```
This improved solution attempts to get the device name from `Constants.deviceName`, and if empty, it tries alternative methods (commented in the code above, that would need to be added based on libraries to implement.)  It handles errors gracefully by defaulting to 'Unknown' if all methods fail.
