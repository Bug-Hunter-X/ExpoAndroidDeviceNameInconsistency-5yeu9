This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceName` API to retrieve the device name on Android devices. In certain cases, the API returns an empty string or an unexpected value instead of the actual device name. This inconsistency is not clearly documented and can lead to unexpected behavior in apps that rely on the device name for functionality or personalization.  The issue is more likely to occur on Android devices running custom ROMs or older versions of the Android operating system.
